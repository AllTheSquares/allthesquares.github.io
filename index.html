    <p class ="about-site">I welcome you to this random website I created out of thin air. Wait, no, via GitHub Pages. This website was created on par with an extra-curricular program, offered by this academy high school thingy in my town. At the same time, you could probably consider this as an HTML experiment, I guess. You'll find a bunch of random things here, I essentially threw a bunch of things to make you guys consider this as a website. How about you click on the hyperlinks to naviagte around the page/</p>
