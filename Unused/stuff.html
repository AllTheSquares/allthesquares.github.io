	<h3> I made this webportal that contains the links to the computer stuff I wanted to talk to you about in class.</h3>
	<body> Finding a good computer during this period is tough, due to the graphics card shortage.</body>
	<body> Below, you will find a list of computers I found. I provided what would be an optimal build for around 1000 if we are going to do it ourselves.</body>

	<body><a href = https://pcpartpicker.com/user/AllTheSquares/saved/#view=R6xDZL> Click here for what I think may be the most optimal build. It could handle the games on low settings at high framerates. </a></body>
	<body> <a href = https://www.bestbuy.com/site/cyberpowerpc-gamer-master-gaming-desktop-amd-ryzen-5-5600g-8gb-memory-amd-radeon-rx-6600-xt-500gb-ssd-black/6479741.p?skuId=6479741> Here's a good Best Buy prebuilt for $1199, equipped with the same processor, better graphics card, and comes with cheap peripherals. </a></body>
	<body><a href = https://www.bestbuy.com/site/asus-rog-gaming-desktop-amd-ryzen-7-3700x-16gb-memory-nvidia-geforce-rtx-3060-1tb-hdd-256gb-ssd/6477650.p?skuId=6477650> Here's a similar one from ASUS. For $1249, It has a better processor and graphics card, but the reviews do not look so hot. Comes with peripherals.</a> </body>
	<body><a href = https://www.bestbuy.com/site/lenovo-legion-tower-5-amd-gaming-desktop-amd-ryzen-7-5700g-16gb-ram-nvidia-geforce-gtx-1660-super-256gb-ssd-1tb-hdd-raven-black/6469939.p?skuId=6469939> Here's another one from Lenovo for $1199. It might be a little overpriced for what it is, but in these times it is good enough.</a></body>
	<body><a href =https://www.microcenter.com/product/637092/lenovo-legion-t5-26amr5-gaming-computer-platinum-collection> Similar computer from Micro Center for $1099, good enough processor (small degrade from the previous), with the same specs.</a> </body>
	<body> Remember, PCs are pricey. Reason being that the current situation with the chips and all is bad. But trust me: we can somehow make it work. </body>
